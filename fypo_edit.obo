def: "A cell phenotype that affects the localization of a protein in a cell." [PomBase:mah]
comment: Encompasses both presence of proteins not normally found in a particular location and decreased levels or absence of proteins normally found in the location.The difference between this term and 'mislocalized protein' (FYPO:0000782) is that 'mislocalized protein' describes a protein that is observed in a place where it is not normally found, whereas 'abnormal protein localization' additionally encompasses the absence of protein from a place where it is normally found, and describes defects in a localization process. FYPO:0000782 can therefore be used in any case where a protein is in a different location in a mutante compared to wild type, whereas additional information is usually required to support annotation to FYPO:0000443 or its descendants.

comment: This is a high-level term whose primary purpose is to organize terms beneath it in the ontology, and we expect that it will seldom be used for direct annotations. Please consider using a more specific term to annotate each phenotype. There may be enough evidence to support annotation to a more specific term such as 'increased transcriptional response to pheromone' (FYPO:0000685); if not, it is safer to annotate to 'increased transcription' (FYPO:0000780) or 'decreased transcription' (FYPO:0000781) rather than explicitly claiming that an effect on regulation was observed.

name: slow cell growth on glycerol carbon source
def: "A cell growth phenotype in which cells grow at a slower rate than normal in a medium containing glycerol as the carbon source." [PomBase:al, PomBase:mah]
comment: Note that trace amounts of another carbon source are usually required for S. pombe growth on glycerol; yeast extract-based rich medium supplies the trace substance, but minimal medium must be supplemented. It is therefore important to annotate the growth medium as an experimental condition when using this term.

comment: Note that mating efficiency is often measured by counting zygotes plus asci, sometimes also including spores, so a change in measured mating efficiency may reflect a change in conjugation frequency (see FYPO:0000031 and its descendants), a change in sporulation (see FYPO:0000121 and its descendants), or both.

name: mislocalized protein
def: "A cell phenotype in which a protein is observed in a particular location where it is not normally found." [PomBase:mah]
comment: The difference between this term and 'abnormal protein localization' (FYPO:0000443) is that 'mislocalized protein' describes a protein that is observed in a place where it is not normally found, whereas 'abnormal protein localization' additionally encompasses the absence of protein from a place where it is normally found. FYPO:0000782 can therefore be used in any case where a protein is in a different location in a mutante compared to wild type, whereas additional information is usually required to support annotation to FYPO:0000443 or its descendants.
