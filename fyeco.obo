name: xylose added
def: "An experimental condition in which xylose was added to the medium or assay buffer in excess compared to standard medium or assay buffers." [PomBase:al]
comment: Note that this term can be used both when the chemical is not normally present in the buffer, or when the buffer normally contains much lower quantities of the chemical so that the chemical is added 'in excess'.

def: "Experiments were performed in rich medium containing xylose as the carbon source, yeast extract and other components. The concentration of xylose is typically around 2%." [PomBase:mlr]
comment: Use the medium terms to specify the general type of growth medium and its carbon source. If certain chemicals not normally found in the medium were added, please also use the 'chemical added/excluded' terms, for instance 'caffeine added' or 'nitrogen excluded'. If a chemical was added in a much lower quantity than normal, please use the 'limited chemical added' conditions, for instance 'limited adenine added'.
