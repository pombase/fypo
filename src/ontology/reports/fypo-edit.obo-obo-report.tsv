ERROR	duplicate_definition	inviable mononucleate vegetative cell with mislocalized septum and anucleate compartment	definition	A physical cellular phenotype observed in the vegetative growth phase of the life cycle in which a cell is inviable, and contains a single nucleus and an asymmetrically located septum. The septum divides the cell into two compartments, one of which contains the nucleus.
