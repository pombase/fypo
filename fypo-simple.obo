[Typedef]
id: during
name: during
xref: GOREL:0000002
property_value: usage "Identifies a process, cell cycle stage or life stage during which a phenotype is observed or relevant." xsd:string

[Typedef]
id: exists_during
name: exists_during
xref: GOREL:0000032
property_value: usage "Identifies a process, cell cycle stage or life stage during which a phenotype that affects a continuant, such as a cellular component or the level of a substance, is observed or relevant." xsd:string

[Typedef]
id: happens_during
xref: GOREL:0000001
property_value: usage "Identifies a process, cell cycle stage or life stage during which a phenotype that affects an occurrent, i.e. a biological process or molecular function, is observed or relevant." xsd:string

[Typedef]
id: has_output
name: has_output
def: "p has output c if either: p has direct output c or p has output input c. Implies that if p happens, c always ensues." [GOC:curators]
xref: RO:0002234
property_value: usage "Def comes from gorel file. Used in FYPO where one phenotype (p) always results in an additional phenotype (c) as a consequence. There may be other ways to get phenotype (c)." xsd:string

[Typedef]
id: has_part
name: has_part
xref: BFO:0000051
property_value: usage "Used in FYPO to link phenotypes that are collections of features to phenotypes representing the features." xsd:string
is_transitive: true

[Typedef]
id: inheres_in
name: inheres_in
xref: RO:0000052
property_value: usage "Used in FYPO as described in PATO best practices; identifies an entity that displays a quality in an entity-quality logical definition. Used only in logical definitions (aka xps)." xsd:string

[Typedef]
id: inheres_in_part_of
name: inheres in part of
xref: RO:0002314
property_value: usage "Used in FYPO as described in MP/HP logical definition best practices for processes, and in an analogous manner for cell/cell part structure; identifies an entity that displays a quality in an entity-quality logical definition. Used only in logical definitions (aka xps)." xsd:string

[Typedef]
id: located_in
name: located in
xref: RO:0001025
property_value: usage "Used in FYPO to indicate where a physical quality phenotype is observed." xsd:string

[Typedef]
id: occurs_at
name: occurs_at
xref: GOREL:0000501
property_value: usage "This relation is not constrained with respect to whether the place where an event occurs completely surrounds, or is adjacent to, the location indicated. Example: chromatin silencing at centromere unfolds_around centromere : Repression of transcription of centromeric DNA by the formation of heterochromatin. Used in FYPO to identify a position where a phenotype is observed or relevant, usually a DNA or RNA sequence feature specified by a SO ID." xsd:string

[Typedef]
id: occurs_in
name: occurs in
xref: BFO:0000066
property_value: usage "Used in FYPO to identify a location, usually a cellular component or cell type, within which a phenotype is observed or relevant." xsd:string

[Typedef]
id: output_of
name: output_of
synonym: "formation results from" EXACT [PomBase:mah]
xref: RO:0002353
property_value: usage "Inverse of has_output. Relation between a structure and a process that forms it, or between one process and a preceding process; A output_of B used where B has_output A isn't always true. Implies that process B is the only way to get output. Used in FYPO where one phenotype (c) always results when another phenotype (p) is present. Phenotype (p) may have other consequences in addition to phenotype (c)." xsd:string

[Typedef]
id: part_of
name: part_of
xref: BFO:0000050
property_value: usage "Used in FYPO to identify phenotypes that are always observed in the context of another, usually larger-scale, phenotype." xsd:string

[Typedef]
id: preceded_by
name: preceded_by
xref: BFO:0000062
property_value: usage "Used in FYPO when a phenotype is observed after another event, usually a GO biological process, has ended, and where there isn't a suitable process to use with a during relation." xsd:string

[Typedef]
id: precedes
name: precedes
xref: BFO:0000063
property_value: usage "Used in FYPO when a phenotype is observed before another event, usually a GO biological process, begins, and where there isn't a suitable process to use with a during relation." xsd:string

[Typedef]
id: qualifier
name: qualifier
property_value: usage "Used in FYPO as described in PATO best practices; placeholder relation to indicate normality/abnormality." xsd:string

[Typedef]
id: towards
name: towards
xref: RO:0002503
property_value: usage "Relation binding a relational quality or disposition to the relevant type of entity. Used in FYPO as described in PATO best practices; identifies abolished GO processes; identifies substances affected by phenotypes." xsd:string
